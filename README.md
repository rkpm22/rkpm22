# Hi there, I'm Raunaksingh Khalsa üëã

## About Me
**Masters in Data Science Student** at Northeastern University with 3.5+ years of data engineering experience. Passionate about **Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science** with hands-on experience in data engineering, feature selection, and building scalable data pipelines for analytics and ML applications.

## I have worked as:

### Michelin - Integration and Data Engineer
Built real-time data streaming systems using Kafka and Spring Boot for ML-ready data processing, specializing in feature engineering and data governance. Optimized data selection and cleaning processes, reducing unnecessary features by identifying business-critical data points. Designed data flows for Corporate Data Lake integration, enabling downstream analytics and ML model training.
### Medialytics - Data Science Intern
Developed regression and classification models in Python and R on social media data, creating real-time trend prediction dashboards with Streamlit. Performed sentiment analysis and feature engineering on social media text and engagement data to identify content performance drivers. Built interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly, enabling data-driven strategies that achieved 100% increase in engagement and 82% rise in reach.

## Key Projects

### ‚öñÔ∏è LegalClause: Legal Contract Analysis
**NLP Classification & Risk Analysis | Fine-tuned Legal-BERT**

Developed an intelligent legal assistant for automated contract clause classification and risk analysis using fine-tuned Legal-BERT model. Achieved **97.87% accuracy** in identifying clause types (Cap on Liability, Audit Rights, Insurance), significantly outperforming baseline TF-IDF + SVM model (85.16% accuracy). Integrated Google's Gemini API for comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation suggestions, deployed via Streamlit chat interface.
